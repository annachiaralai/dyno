# dyno
an opinion dynamics simulator 


This program provides numerical simulations of opinion dynamics based on the model  introduced in the paper  "A nonlinear model of opinion formation on the sphere" by Caponigro, Marco, Anna Chiara Lai, and Benedetto Piccoli. 

ODE solver is based on a Runge Kutta scheme. 

It requires lSDL lSDL_ttf lGL  and lGLUD libraries, data are real-time displayed with GNUPLOT, which is required as well.
